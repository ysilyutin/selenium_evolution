## Selenium WebDriver Evolution | Test Project

In this repository I would like to focus on evolution of test cases written in Python with Selenium WebDriver. I'll start with very easy and simple examples going step by step to the next level to Page Object Model implementation. This code can be used in PyCharm IDE. Feel free to leave a comment, ask questions and share your thoughts.
